# IMG-CourseWork
Introduction to Image sensing and Processing course work at Centrale Lyon 

## Objectives
This course aims to introduce concepts and basic techniques on the acquisition of images, the structure of conventional sensors
and image processing. It covers the foundations and addresses the principles of image formation, image processing, feature
extraction and segmentation of images, and motion tracking. The course will cover concepts such as sensor structure (CCD /
CMOS), image structure, spatial and frequency analysis of images, image descriptors (shape,
contour, etc.), segmentation (point, contours, lines, etc.) and motion tracking. There are many applications, such as medicine,
quality control, artificial vision, satellite imagery, etc.

## Keywords 
image formation, spatial and frequency filtering of images, contour detection, segmentation of images (point,
line, etc.), image descriptors (shape, contour, etc.), image segmentation, motion tracking

## Programme 
• Imaging (cameras, radiometry, colors)
• Phototransduction, sensor structure
• Image structure, quantification, noise
• Spatial analysis (manipulation of the histogram, the gradient and the Laplacian)
• Frequency analysis
• Morphology
• The segmentation of images (detection of points, contour)
